# gex-doc

We needed some place to store:

- Low mocks
- MongoDB Diagrams

And have some control over vernsioning (rather a repo that an google drive shared folder).

We will have to take care and ensure only one person is working o a given file at time (avoid conflicts).

## Other info

Relational repo will be found in Lucid Chart.

General documentation will be found in the wiki (will move the front end wiki to this one).
