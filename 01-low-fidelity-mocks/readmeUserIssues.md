# Issues with User view

## Field Apellido

In Spain we have two surnames, or we change de name of the field or we use one field but in plural.

- Apellido
  - Apellidos
  - Apellido 1 y Apellido 2

## Password Manage

How are we going to manage user passwords?

- Own user can change password?
- How does he get the first password?

## User list view

We need to define how many userÂ´s fields need this view.

- How many phones the user need to see?
- Field id?
